Here's a Playwright test scenario in YAML format for the feature "CHECKOUT_COMPLETE" on an e-commerce site:

```yaml

This YAML script outlines a test scenario where a user logs into an e-commerce site, adds a product to the cart, proceeds to checkout, enters shipping and payment information, and completes the purchase. The assertion at the end checks for an order confirmation message.
